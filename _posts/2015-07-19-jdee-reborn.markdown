[JDEE](https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee) (Java Development
Environment for Emacs) used to be best way to develop Java apps in
Emacs a while back. It offered a ton of
[cool features](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaDevelopmentEnvironment),
like smart auto-completion and a debugger. Unfortunately at some point
the development slowed down significantly and the project went in a
catatonic state. There was pretty much no activity for years in the
official SourceForge repo and there was also no support for features
introduced in Java 5+.

Recently, however, the project migrated to
[GitHub](https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee) and it's now way easier
to get involved. Seems that some people have already started work on
updating JDEE to support modern JDKs and modern Emacs functionality.

That's a really exciting project, as Java support has traditionally
been a weakness of Emacs and I'm writing this post with the hope that
more people will help make JDEE great again.

So what are you waiting for? If you're into Java and friends (Scala,
Clojure, Groovy, etc), check out the new official repo and let's get
this party started!
