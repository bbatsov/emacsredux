The long wait is over - Emacs's development
[has finally migrated from bazaar to git](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-11/msg00681.html).

Now you don't have any excuses not to contribute to Emacs!

If you're wondering where to start I'd suggest taking a look at [this short article](http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2014/11/13/welcome-new-emacs-developers/).
