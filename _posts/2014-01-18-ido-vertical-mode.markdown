If you like `ido`, but don't like the way it displays the available
completion candidates you might want to have a look at
[ido-vertical-mode](https://github.com/gempesaw/ido-vertical-mode.el).

I won't duplicate here the installation instructions, but I'll show you
how `ido-vertical-mode` displays the completion candidates:

![ido-vertical-mode](https://raw.github.com/gempesaw/ido-vertical-mode.el/master/screenshot.gif)

Is this better than the regular `ido`? Depends on your personal
preference I guess. But it's good to have options, right?

That's all for today, folks! Until next time.
