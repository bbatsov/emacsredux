I haven't had much time for Emacs Redux lately, but I wanted everyone to know that I plan (hope)
to go back to writing here at some point. I still love Emacs just as much as always, and my backlog
of topics for blog posts keeps growing. I'm still maintaining all of my Emacs open-source projects,
although probably not as well as I've been doing so in the past. I'm still convinced that:

- Emacs is Magic
- Emacs is Power
- Emacs is Fun
- Emacs is Forever

Lately most of my blogging has been happening over at
Emacs Redux's sibling blog [Meta Redux](https://metaredux.com). Recently I wrote there a few articles that
I would have normally published here, if it weren't for the [Meta Advent blogging challenge](https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/01/meta-advent-2019.html) I participated in. I assume that most of the Emacs Redux readers don't follow Meta Redux, so I'll
list those articles here:

- [Dealing with Expired ELPA GPG Keys](https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/09/dealing-with-expired-elpa-gpg-keys.html)
- [Dead Simple Emacs Screencasts](https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/07/dead-simple-emacs-screencasts.html)
- [Recording Screencasts with Emacs](https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/08/recording-screencasts-with-emacs.html)

I hope you'll find them enjoyable and useful! Until next time!
