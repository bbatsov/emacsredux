I'd often blog about some useful utility functions here. Pretty much
all of them get included in
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude), but I've decided I can do one better and extract those of
them which are most useful/universal into a separate package.

This package is [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux) - a
**C**ollection of **R**idiculously **U**seful e**X**tensions for
Emacs.

You can install it from MELPA and MELPA Stable. Once this is done you
just have to pick keybindings for the commands shipped with
`crux`. I've suggested some keybindings
[here](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux#keybindings). And here's a
small configuration snippet showing how to actually bind keys to some
of `crux`'s commands:

``` elisp
(global-set-key [remap move-beginning-of-line] #'crux-move-beginning-of-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") #'crux-open-with)
(global-set-key [(shift return)] #'crux-smart-open-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-r") #'crux-recentf-ido-find-file)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<backspace>" #'crux-kill-line-backwards))
(global-set-key [remap kill-whole-line] #'crux-kill-whole-line)
```

`crux` also ships with some handy advises that can enhance the operation of existing commands.

For instance - you can use `crux-with-region-or-buffer` to make a
command acting normally on a region to operate on the entire buffer in
the absense of a region. Here are a few examples you can stuff in your
config:

``` elisp
(crux-with-region-or-buffer indent-region)
(crux-with-region-or-buffer untabify)
```

So, this is `crux` for you - simple and neat! I'd love it if you
contributed more useful commands to it, so we can make it even more
versatile!
