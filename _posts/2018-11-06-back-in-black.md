After 3 years of "waiting" for Octopress 3[^1], I've decided I waited
long enough.  Today I (spontaneously) migrated [my personal
blog](http://batsov.com) and Emacs Redux to a vanilla Jekyll setup and
I tweaked a bit their appearance. I'm reasonably pleased with the
results and I finally don't have any excuses not to write.[^2]

I wrote about my experience moving away from Octopress
[here](http://batsov.com/articles/2018/11/05/migrating-from-octopress-to-jekyll/).
If only I had done this a couple of years ago...

I realized recently that it has been over 10 years since my first blog
post.[^3] I've started my humble writing "career" with Wordpress, then
switched to Octopress, and now here we are. One thing never really
changed, though - the quality of my writing. It was always abysmally
bad, as were many of the topics I wrote on. It's really fun to look
back on all of this - I was reading some of my old articles, in the
process of migrating the personal blog to Jekyll, and I couldn't
believe some of the things I wrote. I hope this means I'm getting
wiser with age...

I also realized that this year marked Emacs Redux's fifth
birthday![^4] As usual I didn't manage to achieve the objective I've
set out of myself when I created it - namely produce 10-20 articles
per year for many years to come. The first couple of years were pretty
good for the blog, but then a combination of work and personal
challenges impacted significantly both my open-source work and my writing.

Anyways, lately I've had this burning desire to share so many thoughts
and that really got me excited about writing. Let's see if I'll do
better this time around, or I'll simply fail one more time...

**P.S.** In the mean time I've started another blog, called [Meta
Redux](https://metaredux.com). I plan to do most of my (serious and
creative) writing there, so you might want to check it out.
