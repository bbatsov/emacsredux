`locate` is one extremely popular Unix command that allows you to
search for files in a pre-built database.


One little know fact is that Emacs provides a wrapper around the
command you can invoke with `M-x locate`. You'll be prompted to enter
a search string and you'll be presented with a list of matching
filenames from `locate`'s database. Many of `dired` keybindings are
available in the results buffer (which will be using `locate-mode` major mode).

If you'd like you may change the command invoked by Emacs to supply the
results by altering the `locate-command` variable. Here's how you can
start using OSX's `mdfind` (the command-line interface to `Spotlight`)
instead of `locate`:

``` elisp
(setq locate-command "mdfind")
```

Obviously any command that takes a string argument and returns a list
of files would do here. In all likelihood you'll never want to use
anything other than the default `locate` command, though.
