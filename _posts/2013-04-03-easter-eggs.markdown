Emacs is packed with an insane amount of cool stuff. With Easter fast
approaching[^1] I cannot help but think of **easter eggs** ("secret"
commands, inside jokes, etc). Let's see if we can find some in Emacs!

#### Snake

`M-x snake`

#### Tetris

`M-x tetris`

#### Zone

`M-x zone`
`M-x zone-mode`

#### Doctor

`M-x doctor`

#### Butterfly Mode

`M-x butterfly`[^2]

#### Final Words

This was a short post (and not particularly instructive I guess), but I
hope you've enjoyed it. Share in the comments section any Emacs easter
eggs you know of, that I haven't mentioned.
