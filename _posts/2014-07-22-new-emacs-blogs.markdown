The problem with Emacs blogs is one can never have enough of them (especially the good ones).

I'd like to draw my readers attention to two new blogs:

### lunarsite

[lunarsite](http://www.lunaryorn.com/) is not exactly new (it was
started in March 2014), but I don't think enough people have come
across it, so I'm mentioning it here anyway. It's operated by one of
the most prolific members of the Emacs community in recent years - the
great [Sebastian Wiesner](http://www.lunaryorn.com/pages/about.html)
(of `flycheck` and `cask` fame).

If you're thinking of writing your first major mode - you'll find some
great advice there.

### Endless Parentheses

[Endless Parentheses](http://endlessparentheses.com/) is a brand new blog started by
[Arthur Malabarba](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor). It's dedicated to
concise posts on improving your Emacs productivity.

The content so far is similar to the articles I write here, so if you like `Emacs Redux`
you'll likely enjoy `Endless Parentheses` as well.
