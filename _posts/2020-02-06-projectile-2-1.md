[Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) had a pretty quiet year
since the massive amount of work that lead to the release of [Projectile
2.0](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/releases/tag/v2.0.0) early last year.
These days Projectile is both quite mature and feature-full, so there wasn't
really any burning need to add anything new. Still, there's always some room for improvement. Enter
the recently released Projectile 2.1.

The focus in Projectile 2.1 was bug-fixes and small improvements here and
there. There's no few functionality worth highlighting, other than the addition
of basic integration with `vterm` (`projectile-run-vterm`).  You can read all
about the changes in the [release
notes](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/releases/tag/v2.1.0).

Most likely in the future the focus is going to remain on polishing the existing
functionality (e.g. bug-fixes, performance improvements) as opposed to adding
more features. There are plenty of [open
issues](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues) and help from anyone would
be most welcome!

There's also a lot of work to be done on the documentation side. After launching
<https://docs.projectile.mx> the content there has stayed mostly the same and there's
certainly a lot of ground to cover. At the very least I want to add some animated gifs to the manual
this year, so it's easier for people to understand how to use certain commands.

That's all I have for you today. I hope you'll enjoy the latest Projectile. Until next time!

**P.S.** You can now support my work on Projectile via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bbatsov).
