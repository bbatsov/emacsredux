I recently noticed a new blog targeting beginner and intermediate
Emacs users - [Pragmatic Emacs](http://pragmaticemacs.com/) by
[Ben Maughan](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/people/ben-j-maughan/overview.html).

If you're relatively new to Emacs you should definitely check it
out. Knowing how vast the Emacs ecosystem is, I'm pretty sure that
more experienced Emacs users will also learn a thing or two there.
