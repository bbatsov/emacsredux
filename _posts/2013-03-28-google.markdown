Wouldn't it be cool to be able to invoke a Google search from the
comfort of your beloved text editor? Here's a couple of use-cases. You
may wish to Google the selected region or to be prompted to enter a
query manually. Apart from cool it's also pretty simple to add such a
feature to Emacs.

``` elisp
(defun google ()
  "Google the selected region if any, display a query prompt otherwise."
  (interactive)
  (browse-url
   (concat
    "http://www.google.com/search?ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q="
    (url-hexify-string (if mark-active
         (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))
       (read-string "Google: "))))))
```

This command will display the query results in your default browser.

I'd suggest binding the command to `C-c g` if you plan to use it regularly.

``` elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c g") 'google)
```

`google` is available in
[Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)(but with a `prelude-`
prefix).
