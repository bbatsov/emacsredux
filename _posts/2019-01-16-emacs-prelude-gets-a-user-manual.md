title: Emacs Prelude Gets a User Manual

This is going to be a really short post.

For ages I've planned to create a user manual for [Emacs
Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude), but I never got to doing
so. Writing a _good_ manual is a huge amount of work and I was wary
(and lazy) to commit to doing it.  Today I realized that probably
having *some* manual (even if it's not good) beats having no manual,
so I quickly sliced and diced the old huge README of the project, and
compiled it together into [this proto-manual](https://prelude.emacsredux.com).

I'll try to find some time to improve it, but I can make no
promises. You can certainly help me out by working on the manual
yourselves, though. Prelude is pretty simple, so I assume that
everyone, who has spent a bit of time using it, is more than qualified
to work on improving its documentation.  By the way, the manual
features a dedicated section for [working on the
manual](https://prelude.emacsredux.com/en/latest/contributing/#working-on-the-manual)!
Coincidence? I don't think so.

Keep hacking!
