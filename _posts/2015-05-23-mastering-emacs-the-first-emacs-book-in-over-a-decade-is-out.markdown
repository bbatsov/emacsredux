[Mickey Petersen](https://www.masteringemacs.org/about) just released
[Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/book), the first new
book about our beloved editor, since
[Learning GNU Emacs](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006488.do)(released
way back in 2004).

I haven't had the time to read the book yet, but being familiar with
Mickey's work I have no doubt it's outstanding.  That's all from me
for now - go buy the book and start mastering Emacs.

**P.S.**

I hope we won't have to wait another decade for the next great Emacs book.
