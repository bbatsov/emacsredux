Last month marked 10 years since I've started "Emacs Redux".
The blog's mission I outlined in the [very first post]({% post_url 2013-03-26-blastoff %}) was the following:

> It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and showcase
> its unique advantages over the more "traditional" (conventional) text
> editors and integrated development environments.
>
> Welcome to _Emacs Redux_! In this blog, dedicated to the One True
> Editor, I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
> experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.

In hindsight it's hard to say whether I did well or not. I certainly shared a
lot of tips and tricks. Many of the handy commands I've introduced in the early
articles ended up in the [crux package](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux). On the
other hand - I don't think I did much exploration of the fundamental strengths
of Emacs. Oh, well - you can't win them all!

The blog had some ups and downs and some years I wrote almost nothing here. I
guess this was a reflection of my level of inspiration, shifting interests,
priorities and various life challenges. Today I don't use Emacs nearly as much
as when I started "Emacs Redux", but it's still an integral part of my toolbox
and I still love it. And I still enjoy sharing Emacs tips and tricks that I
discover on the life-long journey called "mastering Emacs".

When I draw the line probably I'm the person who learned the most from "Emacs
Redux", which is fine by me. I can only hope that some of my dear readers found
something of value here as well.  I make no promises for the future, but I'll do
my best to keep "Emacs Redux" alive (and useful) for another decade to come. In
Emacs we trust! M-x forever!
