Last month marked 10 years since I've started "Emacs Redux".
The blog's mission I outlined in the [very first post]({% post_url 2013-03-26-blastoff %}) was the following:

> It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and showcase
> its unique advantages over the more "traditional" (conventional) text
> editors and integrated development environments.
>
> Welcome to _Emacs Redux_! In this blog, dedicated to the One True
> Editor, I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
> experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.

In hindsight it's hard to say whether I did well or not. I certainly shared a
lot of tips and tricks. Many of the handy commands I've introduced in the early
articles ended up in the [crux package](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux). On the
other hand - I don't think I did much exploration of the fundamental strengths
of Emacs. Oh, well - you can't win them all!

The blog had some ups and downs and some years I wrote almost nothing here. I
guess this was a reflection of my level of inspiration, shifting interests,
priorities and various life challenges. Today I don't use Emacs nearly as much
as when I started "Emacs Redux", but it's still an integral part of my toolbox
and I still love it. And I still enjoy sharing Emacs tips and tricks that I
discover on the life-long journey called "mastering Emacs".

Some random trivia & stats:

- I wrote 188 articles in total here
- 2013 was my most productive year with 68 (!!!) articles
- 2017 was my least productive year with only 2 articles (written on 31.12)
- Seems that my most popular Emacs Redux articles ever are about using Emacs with WSL (e.g. [this one]({% post_url 2021-12-19-using-emacs-on-windows-11-with-wsl2 %}))
- Emacs Redux started as an attempt to spin-off the [Emacs content](https://batsov.com/tags/#emacs) from my [original personal blog](https://batsov.com). Funny enough all of my "essays" on Emacs still ended up there.
- I've started to use Emacs in 2005 on my first programming gig (I was a C programmer back then)
- In the period 2004-2005 (my first year working in Unix) I was a vim user
- I wrote my [first blog post about Emacs](https://batsov.com/articles/2008/06/19/emacs-rails/) in 2008
- Projectile and Emacs Prelude were my first major OSS projects
- Emacs it the One True Editor that will bring balance to the Source

When I draw the line probably I'm the person who learned the most from "Emacs
Redux", which is fine by me. I can only hope that some of my dear readers found
something of value here as well.  I make no promises for the future, but I'll do
my best to keep "Emacs Redux" alive (and useful) for another decade to come. In
Emacs we trust! M-x forever!
