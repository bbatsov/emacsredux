From time to time people ask me what's the best way to get in touch with me,
outside of the comments section of each article, that is.

Today we're all on half a dozen social networks, plus another half a dozen of
messaging (chat) services. I don't know about you, but I really hate juggling
all of them and sometimes miss the days of e-mail, IRC and no social networks. I'm an
old-school person who loves the simplicity of e-mail and I encourage all of you
who want to get in touch with me to just write me an e-mail.  I promise to
answer all of you, although I don't promise to do so in a timely fashion. :-)

I welcome all feedback, ideas about future Emacs Redux articles and any good conversation about
Emacs, Lisp, Life, the Universe and everything in between.

I have a couple of e-mail addresses for you to choose from:

* my first name at emacsredux dot com (you can use this one for questions and feedback)
* topics at emacsredux dot com (you can suggest here topics for me to cover down the road)

The second address exists mostly to automate the filing of topic suggestions under a dedicated folder, so I won't lose track of any.
I've setup the Emacs Redux addresses only recently, when I migrated my e-mail [from GMail to Fastmail](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/07/31/hasta-la-vista-gmail.html).

Apart from e-mail you can also get in touch with me on:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbatsov) (my favorite social network)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov) (via issues, PRs and discussions on my projects)
* [CIDER's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/nFPpynQPME) (CIDER is my biggest Emacs Lisp project)

That's all I have for you today. Looking forward to hearing from you!
