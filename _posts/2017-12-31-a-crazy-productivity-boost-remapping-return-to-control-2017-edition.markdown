Back in 2013 I wrote about my favourite productivity boost in Emacs,
namely [remapping Return to
Control](http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/11/12/a-crazy-productivity-boost-remap-return-to-control/),
which in combination with the classic remapping of `CapsLock` to
`Control` makes it really easy to get a grip on Emacs's obsession with
the Control key.

In the original article I suggested to OS X (now macOS) users the tool
`KeyRemap4MacBook`, which was eventually renamed to
[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). Unfortunately this tool
stopped working in macOS Sierra, due to some internal kernel
architecture changes.

That was pretty painful for me as it meant that on my old MacBook
I couldn't upgrade to the newest macOS editions and on my new
MacBook I couldn't type properly in Emacs (as it came with Sierra pre-installed)...
Bummer!

Fortunately 2 years later this is finally solved - the Karabiner team
rewrote Karabiner from scratch for newer macOS releases and recently
added my dream feature to the new `Karabiner Elements`. Unlike in the
past though, this remapping is not actually bundled with Karabiner by
default, so you have to download and enable it manually from
[here](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_and_return_to_ctrl).

That's actually even better than what I had originally suggested, as
here it's also suggested to use `CapsLock` with a dual purpose as
well - `Control` when held down and `Escape` otherwise.  I have no
idea how this never came to my mind, but it's truly epic! A crazy
productivity boost just got even crazier!

Enjoy!
