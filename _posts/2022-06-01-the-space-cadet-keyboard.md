Have you ever wondered about the backstory of the (somewhat cryptic) `Meta`,
`Super` and `Hyper` keys in Emacs? Well, they come from a legendary Lisp
machines keyboard from the 70s, called the space-cadet:

Here's what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard) has to say about it:

> The space-cadet keyboard is a keyboard designed by John L. Kulp in 1978 and
> used on Lisp machines at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which
> inspired several still-current jargon terms in the field of computer science
> and influenced the design of Emacs. It was inspired by the Knight keyboard,
> which was developed for the Knight TV system, used with MIT's Incompatible
> Timesharing System.
>
> The space-cadet keyboard was equipped with seven modifier keys: four keys for
> bucky bits (`Control`, `Meta`, `Super`, and `Hyper`), and three shift keys,
> called `Shift`, `Top`, and `Front` (which was labeled on the front of the key;
> the top was labeled `Greek`). `Meta` had been introduced on the earlier Knight
> keyboard, while `Hyper` and `Super` were introduced by this keyboard. Each
> group was in a row, thus allowing easy chording, or pressing of several
> modifier keys; for example, `Control+Meta+Hyper+Super` could be pressed with
> the fingers of one hand, while the other hand pressed another key.
>
> Many keys had three symbols on them, accessible by means of the shift keys: a
> letter and a symbol on the top, and a Greek letter on the front. For example,
> the `G` key had a "G" and an up-arrow on the top, and the Greek letter gamma on
> the front.

Pretty cool, right? That's one of the aspects of Emacs that I totally love - it
carries a lot of history with it! If it weren't for Emacs the space-cadet
keyboard would have probably been long forgotten by now.
