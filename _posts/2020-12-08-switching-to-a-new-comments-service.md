Just wanted to let you know that for [various reasons](https://fatfrogmedia.com/delete-disqus-comments-wordpress/) I've migrated the comments of Emacs Redux from
Disqus to [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/). I've described the process in a [dedicated article](https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/12/07/migrating-from-disqus-to-hyvor-talk.html).

The migration process converted all Disqus comments to guest comments in Hyvor, which is a bit unfortunate, but unavoidable.
Still, I think that's a small price to pay for a privacy-focused (and more developer-friendly) solution with better usability. I hope that this transition
will result in more interesting discussions taking place here and more Emacs Lisp snippets shared via the comments! Meta-X forever!
