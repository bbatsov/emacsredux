Securing funding for OS projects and blogs (outside of displaying annoying ads)
is a hard endeavor.  While I'd love to raise enough cash to work on
CIDER, projectile and Emacs itself for an entire year through some
wildly successful crowdfunding campaign, that's unlikely to ever
happen.

That said, I recently discovered an interesting alternative to one-off
crowdfunding campaigns called [gratipay](http://gratipay.com).
Self-described as `sustainable crowdfunding` (meaning people will get
microdonations (say half a buck) from their patrons each week) it seems like a
reasonable way to raise a modest sum of money so you could work on
open-source projects more than your regular schedule might permit.

So, if you like Emacs Redux and the Emacs projects in which I'm involved like:

* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - An Emacs distribution built on top of GNU Emacs 24
* [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Project Interaction Library for Emacs, that stays out of your way
* [clojure-mode](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode) - A major mode for programming in Clojure
* [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) - A Clojure programming environment for Emacs
* [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode) - An annoying companion on your journey to Emacs mastery
* [rubocop-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Emacs integration for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
* [zenburn-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) - The Zenburn color theme, ported to Emacs
* [solarized-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs) - The Solarized color theme, ported to Emacs
* [puppet-mode](https://github.com/lunaryorn/puppet-mode) - A mode for editing Puppet 3 manifests
* [swift-mode](https://github.com/chrisbarrett/swift-mode) - A mode for editing Swift code
