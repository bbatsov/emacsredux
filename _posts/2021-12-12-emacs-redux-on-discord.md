A while ago I've created a Discord server for conversations
related to Emacs Redux and my open-source Emacs projects (e.g. Emacs Prelude, crux and Projectile).
One thing that I forgot to do was announce it, therefore this short article.

Feel free to join the server [here](https://discord.gg/3Cf2Qpyry5).

And yeah, I know Discord is not free
software, but it's [great software](https://metaredux.com/posts/2021/10/23/using-discord-for-oss-projects.html) for my needs. I'm not as idealistic as I used to be in the past.
