While writing the title of my [previous post]({% post_url
2021-11-01-installing-emacs-s-elisp-sources-on-debian-ubuntu %}), I've started
to wonder for the thousandth time what's the right possessive form for Emacs -
Emacs's or Emacs'. I've always opted for "Emacs's", as that's consistent with
what I've learned from "The Elements of Style" book a long time ago, but I've seen
plenty of people use "Emacs'", so I wanted to find some definitive opinion on
the matter.

I was amused to find out that even the Emacs maintainers were not fully aligned on the matter, as illustrated by [this mailing list discussion from 2012](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-02/msg00649.html):

It's an interesting conversation, where most people agree that "Emacs's" is the way to go. I was relieved to see this, as I don't have to change my habits. Case closed.
