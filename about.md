## About Me

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov), contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](https://batsov.com/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](https://batsov.com/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

You can learn more about me [here](https://batsov.com/about/).

## About Emacs Redux

> redux <br>
> adjective
>   1. brought back; resurgent: <br>
>   the Emacs era redux.

While many people consider Emacs (and *vim* for that matter) a remnant
of the Dark Ages of computing, we (the crazy Emacs devotees) know
better!  It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and
showcase its unique advantages over the more "traditional"
(conventional) text editors and integrated development environments.

In this blog, dedicated to the One True
Editor, I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.

## Meta Redux

I run a separate blog focused mainly on programming and my open-source work. It's called [Meta
Redux](https://metaredux.com).

## Contact

Today we're all on half a dozen social networks, plus another half a dozen of
messaging (chat) services. I don't know about you, but I really hate juggling
all of them. I'm an old-school person who loves the simplicity of e-mail and I encourage
all of you who want to get in touch with me to just write me an e-mail.
I promise to answer all of you, although I don't promise to do so in a timely fashion. :-)

I welcome all feedback, ideas about future articles and any good conversation about
Emacs, Lisp, Life, the Universe and everything else.

I have a couple of options for you to choose from:

* my first name at emacsredux dot com (you can use this one for questions and feedback)
* topics at emacsredux dot com (you can suggest here topics for me to cover down the road)

I can heartily recommend Fastmail to everyone looking for a great email service
that respects your privacy. Using my [affiliate link to sign up](https://ref.fm/u26676944) will give you a 10% discount for the first year.

Apart from e-mail you can also get in touch with me on:

* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/batsov.net) (my favorite social network)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbatsov)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov) (via issues, PRs and discussions on my projects)

Looking forward to hearing from you!

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a Windows 10/WSL 2 user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].
