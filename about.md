My name is [Bozhidar](http://batsov.com). I'm an Emacs zealot (and a
software engineer) from Bulgaria.

I happen to maintain a few Emacs-related projects:

* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - An Emacs distribution built on top of GNU Emacs
* [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Project Interaction Library for Emacs, that stays out of your way

* [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) - A Clojure programming environment for Emacs
* [inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure) - Basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess
* [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode) - An annoying companion on your journey to Emacs mastery
* [rubocop-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Emacs integration for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

Why does **Emacs Redux** exist?

While many people consider Emacs (and *vim* for that matter) a remnant
of the Dark Ages of computing, we (the crazy Emacs devotees) know
better!  It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and
showcase its unique advantages over the more "traditional"
(conventional) text editors and integrated development environments.

In this blog, dedicated to the One True
Editor, I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.

Don't hesitate to contact me with questions, feedback and suggestions

site) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/bbatsov).
