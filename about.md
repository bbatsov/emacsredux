## About Me

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov), contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](https://metaredux.com/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](https://metaredux.com/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

I'm living in Sofia, Bulgaria and you should totally ping me if you're
ever in my part of the world!

## About Emacs Redux

While many people consider Emacs (and *vim* for that matter) a remnant
of the Dark Ages of computing, we (the crazy Emacs devotees) know
better!  It's time to bring Emacs under the spotlight once more and
showcase its unique advantages over the more "traditional"
(conventional) text editors and integrated development environments.

In this blog, dedicated to the One True
Editor, I'll be sharing with you useful tips and tricks to make your
experience with Emacs more productive and more enjoyable.

## Meta Redux

I run a separate blog without any particular focus. It's called [Meta
Redux](https://metaredux.com).

## Colophon

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses
the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a macOS user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
[^3]: But at least I'm honest with myself.
[^4]: Also known as the "best keyboard ever". Seriously!
[^5]: Also known as the "worst keyboard ever". No shit!
