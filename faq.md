## Is Emacs truly the One True Editor?

Yes.

## How much time does it take to master Emacs?

It's a life-long journey.

## What's with the `er-` prefix in code examples?

Emacs doesn't have namespaces and it's a common convention to prefix
functions to avoid potential name conflicts. `er` stands for Emacs Redux.

## How to evaluate code snippets in Emacs?

Just copy the snippet to some Emacs Lisp source buffer, place your
cursor inside the snippet and press `C-M-x`).

Alternative you can start an Elisp REPL using `M-x ielm` and paste the
snippets there.
